## About Myself
Hi, I’m Ana, a Senior Product Manager with 6+ years of experience in SaaS.
I led product strategy and development for B2B and B2B2C products that connect thousands of customers with their utilities and help make energy use more sustainable.
I love what I do. I get to shape products from idea to delivery — and there’s nothing better than seeing something you imagined come to life and actually improve people’s lives. Watching users interact with the features you helped create is always a thrill.
In my free time, I’m usually playing ball in the park with my dog Pekka, going for a run, or reading on my porch. I’m also learning how to code — especially interested in how AI can help us make scientific breakthroughs and make our lives better.
